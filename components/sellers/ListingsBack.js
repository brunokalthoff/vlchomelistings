            If you&apos;re like most first time sellers, you may worry about being locked into a lengthy listing agreement with a less-than-competent real estate agent, costing your home valuable time and exposure on the market. Here at VLA, we are confident in our team&apos;s ability to provide you with the most authentic real estate experience, and that&apos;s why we offer 100% satisfaction or your listing back! That&apos;s right! If at any time during your listing, you become dissatisfied with the way we are marketing your property, just give us a call and we will cancel the listing. Why do we make such a offer? We know once you hire us, you will notice an immediate difference, because we get results! We have a strong opinion about real estate service. We believe that if you&apos;re unhappy with the level of service you receive for any reason, you should have the power to fix it. It takes a strong belief in the quality of our service to make this kind of offer, and we are proud to make it, because we never settle for anything less than the highest level of client service we&apos;ve promised!
